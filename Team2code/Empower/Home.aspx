		The ability of <strong>women to control their own fertility</strong> is 
		absolutely fundamental to women’s empowerment and equality. When a woman 
		can plan her family, she can plan the rest of her life. When she is 
		healthy, she can be more productive. And when her reproductive 
		rights—including the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of 
		her children, and to make decisions regarding reproduction free of 
		discrimination, coercion and violence—are promoted and protected, she 
		has freedom to participate more fully and equally in society.<br />
